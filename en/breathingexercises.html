  <h3>Breathing exercises</h3>
<p>Guides to the "Shuttle" and "Sound Hunt" exercises. Audio in Ukrainian language only</p>
<h4>General recommendations (for both exercises)</h4>
 <div class="essential_audio" data-url="audio/Introduction.mp3"></div>
            <p>The idea behind these practices and the logic of their application are as follows: first, we learn to regain inner peace and balance (Chovnik), and then we proceed to the practice of hunting for sounds and observing reactions to the auditory palette.</p>
            <p>The first part contains three blocks - respiratory, physical, and an element of trust in one&apos;s own internal state, whatever it may be.</p>
            <p>In the second part, I suggest delving a bit more into the world of sounds of different pitches, while observing the behavior of emotions, memories, associations, visual images, and overall mental state.</p>
            <p>Special preparation for the practice is not required. The ability to breathe, feel one&apos;s own body, or even imagine specific areas is entirely sufficient groundwork.</p>
            <p>Practice duration: 10-15 minutes. Sometimes longer if one enjoys a particular step.</p>
            <p>Hypothesis regarding results: the return of the ability to slow down the turns of the mind and thoughts using always accessible methods, the restoration of the ability to marvel and discover the world anew (through sounds and trust in sounds not only as a source of danger).</p>
            <p>Important recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the initial stages, it&apos;s advisable to have a quieter place for practices (as much as possible under different circumstances). This allows for a better understanding of what is happening with the inner world, body, and psyche.</li>
                <li>Comfortable clothing, a chair, or sofa for back support. Don&apos;t forget to eat, drink some water. It is not advisable to use alcohol and narcotic substances (from the experience of participants in various courses who tried to combine them - it is not the most pleasant experiment in life).</li>
                <li>For the second practice, the music should be calm, not overly rhythmic, and preferably without vocal accompaniment at the beginning.</li>
                <li>It&apos;s recommended to have a notebook or sketchbook to record the experience. If possible, work in a small group or with friends. Sharing the experience in a trusting atmosphere preserves it better and later, during moments of &quot;breakdown&quot; and &quot;all is lost,&quot; one can rely on it.</li>
            </ul>
 <h4>Shuttle</h4>
<div class="essential_audio" data-url="audio/Chovnyk Exercise.mp3"></div>
<p>The practice consists of three elements: breathing, body awareness and relaxation, and listening to the experience of silence. It is not a self-sufficient formal meditation practice, but it contains all the necessary &quot;bricks.&quot;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Breathing (10 breath cycles):</strong> The simplest scheme is 3 seconds inhale, 9 seconds exhale. Deep breaths into the full chest and exhaling through the mouth - it can also be intense, but adjust it to your own comfort. Another option is to try the 4-7-8 pattern, where 4 is inhale, 7 is breath retention, and 8 is exhale through the mouth (creating a small opening with the lips, similar to blowing, but longer). The aim here is to activate the parasympathetic nervous system through the extended exhale duration, responsible for calmness, rest, and digestion. Some sensations may include stars in the eyes, light-headedness, tension in various areas of the body (abdomen, chest, neck).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Body Awareness (6 minutes):</strong> Move with your breath through the body - on inhale feel one part, on exhale feel another.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inhale: forehead + eyebrows; Exhale: jaw</li>
                            <li>Inhale: crown; Exhale: neck</li>
                            <li>Inhale: upper shoulders; Exhale: arms completely</li>
                            <li>Inhale: chest; Exhale: abdomen</li>
                            <li>Inhale: shoulder blades; Exhale: back completely</li>
                            <li>Inhale: pelvis; Exhale: legs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Release the weight of the body downward with each exhale to help muscles relax. The goal is to continue calming the sympathetic nervous system and activating the parasympathetic. Reestablish the connection with body sensations, assisting the brain in grounding itself amidst crisis narratives, turning away from anxiety/catastrophizing towards &quot;oh, this is interesting, there&apos;s something here, something ticklish, something SPECIFIC IS BEING FELT.&quot; Focus on bodily sensations, if possible, rather than imagining the body. Ultimately, this is a matter of time and skill.</p>
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li><strong>Trust (5-10 minutes):</strong> Just be and observe effects until thoughts start buzzing again.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The crucial achievement here is restoring the relationship with one&apos;s own silence or noise. Trust in oneself in different states, with different emotions or their absence, thoughts and their absence. The difficulty of traumatic experiences lies in the loss of trust in primary, personal experiencing. Our brain stops trusting its observations, and the inner world is perceived as unreliable, even threatening. It&apos;s important, in consciousness, after the first two steps, to give oneself a chance to live again, to move forward.</p>
  <h4>Sound hunting</h4>
 <div class="essential_audio" data-url="audio/Listening Exercise.mp3"></div>
 <p>In this exercise, we attentively listen to the auditory palette. It is preferable to choose ambient or instrumental music (with percussion) for the practice, where you can find a certain overall melodiousness or mood, high-pitched, ringing, low, deep sounds.</p>
                                    <p>After completing the &quot;Chovnik&quot; practice,</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Allow attention to &quot;wander&quot;</strong> and listen to all sounds chaotically like flashes around. Without focusing on anything specific, intentionally push attention further. Imagine that your attention is like a somewhat excited and chaotic puppy that has just gone outside, and there&apos;s SO MUCH INTERESTING around.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>On the second step, <strong>listen to background low sounds or those distant from us</strong>. Here, allow attention to &quot;stick&quot; and ground to something &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;humming.&quot; As if letting attention gently fall onto a huge cushion made of low sound.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>At the third stage, <strong>hunt for one and only one sound in its life cycle</strong>: from the moment it appears, stretching to the moment it almost completely fades away. Observe how the note lives, intertwines with others, reaches its peak, and then slowly fades.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>On the fourth step, <strong>expand the range of sounds</strong> and allow their imaginary herds to run through our consciousness-attention. Sometimes, it will create a strange spatial effect, as if the boundaries of our hearing have significantly expanded (this effect is due to somewhat improved attention in the previous steps).</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>To conclude the practice, choose a classical composition and just listen attentively, allowing attention to immerse, float in the notes, search, touch something that may have been overlooked until now. It&apos;s better to choose something lighter, calm, and already with a positive listening experience. Save anxious music for times when you are ready.</p>
                                    <p>Prerequisites for practices: it&apos;s better to work with the &quot;Chovnik&quot; exercise and let the mind/psyche slow down.</p>
                                    <p>Practice duration: 15-20 minutes (approximately 3-5 minutes for each stage).</p>
                                    <p>What are we achieving here? An important reminder in this practice: we do not aim to achieve perfect hearing, become professional sound engineers. Here, we need to allow ourselves to regain faith in the ability to enjoy simple things or just show interest in events around/inside us. Approach it as an exercise, as a game, not as a duty and task. An exercise in which we give a chance for the inner child to remind us that the sounds of the world are not only about danger. The world is usually not catastrophic, and a catastrophe is a rare event that should also be valued as an experience.</p>
                                    <p>If we manage to awaken interest, then anxiety, fear, and depressive thoughts will begin to loosen. This provides a pause for the psyche, which circumstances and traumatic experiences sometimes take away.</p>
